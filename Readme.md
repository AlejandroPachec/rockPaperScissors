## My process
This is a small project that I started developing based on the JavaScript learning process. At first the html was as simple as it could be in order to focus on the JS. When the function was working properly I did some adjusting as to provide feedback to the user as them were playing such as who won the round and showing the provisional result.

Next step was getting some simple images that represented each one of the Rock, paper, scissors options to insert on the html. Then I downloaded a buttom that allowed the user to start the game with an "onclick". That way the game didnÂ´t started everytime the web was refreshed. 
For now the inputs from the user come from text prompts but the objective is to change it to "onclick" events in the different options.

Work in progress... Any feedback will be gladly welcome ðŸ˜Š
